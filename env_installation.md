# Environment installation

1. Make sure you have conda installed in your system. [Instructions link here.](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation)
2. Then, get the `conda_env.yml` file, and from the same directory, run `conda env create -f conda_env.yml`. If you don't have a GPU, you can remove the line saying `- nvidia::cudatoolkit=11.1`.
3. Activate the environment, `conda activate hw1_dagger`.
4. Then, install pybullet gym using the following instructions: https://github.com/benelot/pybullet-gym#installing-pybullet-gym
